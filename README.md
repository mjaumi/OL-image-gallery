## Description

In this project I have created a image gallery as per requirements. Here user can select one or multiple images and can delete them. Moreover, user can drag and reorder the images as they want. The whole project is responsive for mobiles, tablets as well as for desktop. I have used `React.js`, `TypeScript`, `Tailwind CSS` & `Context API` to create this application. For drag and sorting feature I have used `sortablejs` library.
